## Senior Project, 2018

#### _Student:_ Emily Johsnon

#### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi

### Objective

The objective of this senior project is to learn about power and sample size computations with correlated data.  Motivation:

### Motivation 

This is inspired by a researcher in the kinesiology department who wants to examine the effectiveness of bottle feeding an infant with a clear bottle (control group) versus an opaque bottle (treatment group).  The primary aim is to determine if weight gain is lower in the treatment group, as assessed by weight for length z-scores (WLZ).  In both the treatment and control group, the infantsâ€™ WLZ is to be assessed at baseline and 4 week follow up, so at the end of the study we can compare the difference in the WLZ scores between the two groups.  In this project we will do simulation to examine how the correlation in WLZ scores between the baseline and 4 week follow up affects the sample size and power calculations.  


### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository which contains the following:**

1.  A simulation to examine how the correlation in WLZ scores between the baseline and 4 week follow up affects the sample size and power calculations.

2.  A log of hours spent on senior project, which includes date, hours, and activity summary.

3.  A one page summary of your senior project.

4.  A final report.

5.  A final presentation to the Statistics Department.


### Specific Aims

*Note: For any DataCamp class that you take, it would be helpful to take notes (and post them here), so that we can re-vist or discuss important concepts.*

**1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.  Here are some GitHub resources:**

**2.  Adhere to good programming practices:**

  + Write all R code according to Hadley Wickam's Style Guide: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
  
  + Learn about how to write R functions: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r 
  
  
  
**3.  Read and summarize relevant literature to better understand the motivating framework.**

+ See Ventura literature folder.  

**4.  Explore the data provided by Dr. Ventura to identify reasonable parameter estimates.**

+  *Data coming soon.*

**5.  Execute a simulation to examine how the correlation in WLZ scores between the baseline and 4 week follow up affects the sample size and power calculations.**

+  Helpful resources??

**6.  Write the final report in a reproducible manner.**
